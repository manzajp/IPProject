        <h4>Skudai, Johor - Vaccination</h4>

        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>
            People of Skudai in Johor have not received any opening of vaccination centre for almost 1 week which is alarming considering that the government tends to achieve herd immunity soon and prevent further cases from happening.
            We realised that using this portal to reach out to various hospitals and grab their attention to us rather than bothering the government as they are only partly involve with the vaccination centres and can focus on other things as well.
